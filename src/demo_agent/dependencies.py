dependencies.py

This module defines dependencies used in FastAPI applications for Language Model (LLM) agents.

Dependencies are reusable functions or objects that can be used as parameters in endpoint functions.
They help to organize and reuse common logic across multiple endpoints.

In this file, dependencies specific to LLM agents, such as authentication, authorization, and input
validation, can be defined. These dependencies can then be injected into the route functions
of FastAPI applications.

Example:
    ```
    from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
    from .dependencies import get_current_user

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/users/me")
    async def read_users_me(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
        return current_user
    ```
